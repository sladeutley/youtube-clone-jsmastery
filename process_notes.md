In general, I have set this up to follow along with the git commits, but to get started, I:

1) npx create-react-app app-name
2) create repository in github (DO NOT ADD Readme)
3) connect react project to my github repo (using my notes)
4) set up acct at rapidapi.com so can use youtube v3 api
5) install rapidApi vs code extension
6) install correct packages - copy and paste my dependencies in package.json (which i took from teacher of this course) then type 'npm install' or 'npm install --legacy-peer-deps' (installs same exact versions of dependencies) in terminal. Type in termnal 'npm audit fix' to fix , or 'npm audit fix --force' to fix vulnerabilities, BUT he says not to fix vulnerabilities yet?? --> MAKE SURE HE mentions how to fix this later bc tried to do audit fix force and it made it where there were more vulnerabilites
7) just start following github commits at this point for process
